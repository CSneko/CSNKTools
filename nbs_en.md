[中文用户请点击这里](nbs.md)
## Install Note Block Studio
Download the latest version of [Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/) from the official website, and then run the Minecraft.Note.Block.Studio.exe file

If you have already installed Wine or Windows system, you can skip this step.

If you are using a Linux system, you may need to install [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) first. Use the following command to install it.

Ubutun/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install wine
```
Or compile from [download binary files from the official website](https://www.winehq.org/)

The process of installing Note Block Studio is basically the same as other Windows software, so I won’t go into details here.

After the installation is completed, it will look like the picture below:
